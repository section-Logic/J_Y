    Hi, Im Jesse — a full stack developer who thrives at the intersection of creativity and functionality. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend frameworks, I build web experiences that are as elegant as they are efficient.
    Whether you need a sleek, responsive front end or a robust, scalable backend system, I bring a detail-oriented approach to every project. I’ve worked across industries, blending technical precision with a keen eye for design aesthetics — because great code should look good too.
    I love solving complex problems and transforming ideas into interactive, user-friendly solutions. My services range from custom web development and performance optimization to UX refinement and API integrations. If you're building something from scratch or refining an existing system, I’d love to help.
    Lets turn your vision into code that performs.
